# API ASSIGNMENT

## Using a public API

For this assignment, I used a public API that contains questions from the show Jeopardy! My intention was to create a function that would allow a user to select a value and category, and view a question that fits that selection. 

Link to the API: http://jservice.io/

If I had more time, I would work on randomizing the list of questions my website grabs from the API array. Currently my site uses the same 100 questions each time instead of randomizing the categories upon reloading.
